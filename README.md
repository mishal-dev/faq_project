Here's a detailed README template for your Django project, which integrates a FAQ system with multilingual support, caching, and other features.

# Django FAQ System with Multilingual Support

This is a Django-based FAQ system that supports storing frequently asked questions and answers in multiple languages. It leverages the `django-ckeditor` for rich text answers and integrates caching with Redis for performance optimization.

## Features
- Multilingual support for questions and answers (Hindi, Bengali, and English).
- Caching mechanism using Redis to improve performance.
- WYSIWYG editor integration with `django-ckeditor`.
- Automatic translation of questions and answers to Hindi and Bengali using Google Translate API.
- REST API for retrieving FAQs in different languages.
- Admin interface to manage FAQs.
- Docker support for containerized deployment.

## Prerequisites

Ensure the following dependencies are installed on your system:

- Python 3.x
- Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)
- Redis (for caching)
- PostgreSQL (or any other database of your choice)

## Installation

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/faq-system.git
cd faq-system
```

### Step 2: Set Up the Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

It’s recommended to use a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with other Python projects.

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Set Up the Database

Before running the server, make sure you have your database set up. The project is configured to work with PostgreSQL by default. Ensure that your PostgreSQL instance is running and create a database.

```bash
# PostgreSQL commands
CREATE DATABASE faq_db;
```

Edit the `DATABASES` section in `settings.py` to reflect your database connection details.

### Step 5: Apply Migrations

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

### Step 6: Create Superuser (for Admin Panel)

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

### Step 7: Run the Development Server

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

You can now access the application at `http://localhost:8000/`.

## API Endpoints

### Get FAQs (English by default)

To fetch the FAQs in English:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/faqs/
```

### Get FAQs in Hindi

To fetch the FAQs in Hindi:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/faqs/?lang=hi
```

### Get FAQs in Bengali

To fetch the FAQs in Bengali:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/faqs/?lang=bn
```

### Caching

The FAQ data for each language is cached using Redis for performance optimization. The cache is set for 1 hour.

To check the cache:

```bash
# In Redis CLI
127.0.0.1:6379> GET faqs_en
```

### Admin Interface

The Django admin interface is available for managing FAQs. Log in with the superuser credentials you created earlier at `http://localhost:8000/admin`.

---

## Docker Deployment (Optional)

If you prefer to run the project using Docker, you can use the provided `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml`.

### Step 1: Build the Docker Image

```bash
docker build -t faq-system .
```

### Step 2: Run the Docker Container

```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 faq-system
```

This will expose the app on `http://localhost:8000`.

### Docker Compose (Optional for Multi-Container Setup)

If you're using `docker-compose.yml` to orchestrate the web app, Redis, and PostgreSQL, use the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This command will automatically build and start all containers defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file, including Redis and PostgreSQL.

---

## Testing

Unit tests for the project can be run using `pytest`:

```bash
pytest
```

Ensure that tests cover model methods, API responses, and caching functionality.
